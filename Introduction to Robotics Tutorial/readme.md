# Task 1 - Pick & Place
## Purpose
### Pick Tokens and Blocks from the feeder
1. Position the Robot: Move the robot to the feeder location with the help of pre-defined points
2. Grab the object: When the robot arm is above the token/block, activates the nozzle to grab the token/block to move to the next position
### Move to the fixture to calibrate the center of tokens and blocks
1. Position the Robot: Move the token/block to the fixture plate (pre-defined points), ensuring no collision with other components in the workspace
2. Turn Off the nozzle: Release the token/block in the fixture
3. Calibrate the piece: Align the token/block in the fixture with help of the robot
4. Prepare to the next position: Grab again the token/block in the calibrated center to move to the next position
### Insert into Tray holes
1. Position the Robot: Navigate the robot arm to the tray position (pre-defined points) with the calibrated block/token
2. Insert the piece: Locate the hole of the corresponding token/block and insert it slowly to avoid serious collisions
3. Leave the piece to Repeat Process: Release the token/block once is in position and repeat the process with the other tokens/blocks
## Components üïπÔ∏èüîß
- 1 Feeder
- 1 Fixture
- 1 Tray
- 3 Tokens
- 3 Blocks
- I/O Box

# Task 2 - Stacking
## Purpose
### Pick Tokens and Blocks from the feeder
1. Position the Robot: Move the robot to the feeder location with the help of pre-defined points
2. Grab the object: When the robot arm is above the token/block, activates the nozzle to grab the token/block to move to the next position
### Stack the blocks and tokens on top of each other
1. Position the Robot: Move the robot to the base location with the help of a pre-defined point
2. Stack the blocks and tokens: Alternate between blocks and tokens to stack on top of each other
## Components üïπÔ∏èüîß
- 1 Feeder
- 1 Base
- 10 Tokens
- 10 Blocks
- I/O Box

# Task 3 - Integration
## Purpose
### Pick Tokens and Blocks from the feeder
1. Position the Robot: Move the robot to the feeder location with the help of pre-defined points
2. Use Sensor: Activate a pressure sensor to know how many blocks and tokens are in the feeder
3. Grab the object: When the robot arm is above the token/block, activates the nozzle to grab the token/block to move to the next position
### Move to the fixture to calibrate the center of tokens and blocks
1. Position the Robot: Move the token/block to the fixture plate (pre-defined points), ensuring no collision with other components in the workspace
2. Turn Off the nozzle: Release the token/block in the fixture
3. Calibrate the piece: Align the token/block in the fixture with help of the robot or using a cylinder
4. Prepare to the next position: Grab again the token/block in the calibrated center to move to the next position
### Insert into Tray holes
1. Position the Robot: Navigate the robot arm to the tray position (pre-defined points) with the calibrated block/token
2. Insert the piece: Locate the hole of the corresponding token/block and insert it slowly to avoid serious collisions
3. Leave the piece to Repeat Process: Release the token/block once is in position and repeat the process with the other tokens/blocks
### Return the blocks and tokens to the feeder (Reverse Function)
1. Position the Robot: Move the robot to the tray location
2. Use Sensor: Activate a pressure sensor to know is there are something in the tray position, if detect nothing will move to the next position
3. Perform inverse operations: If detect an object in the tray the robot will perform fixture and place operation leaving the block/token to the feeder again
