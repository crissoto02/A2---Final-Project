# Task 1 - Pick & Place
## Purpose
### Pick Tokens and Blocks from the feeder
1. Position the Robot: Move the robot to the feeder location with the help of pre-defined points
2. Grab the object: When the robot arm is above the token/block, activates the nozzle to grab the token/block to move to the next position
### Move to the fixture to calibrate the center of tokens and blocks
1. Move the token/block to the fixture plate (pre-defined points), ensuring no collision with other components in the workspace
2. Release the token/block in the fixture
3. Align the token/block in the fixture with help of the robot
4. Grab again the token/block in the calibrated center to move to the next position
### Insert into Tray holes
1. Navigate the robot arm to the tray position (pre-defined points) with the calibrated block/token
2. Locate the hole of the corresponding token/block and insert it slowly to avoid serious collisions
3. Release the token/block once is in position and repeat the process with the other tokens/blocks
