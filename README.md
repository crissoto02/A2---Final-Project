## [INTRODUCTION TO ROBOTICS](Introduction%20to%20Robotics/)
In this project, a simulation of a hybrid robot will be developed. The robot is designed with an articulated arm equipped with ultraviolet (UV) lights along its length, specifically intended 
to disinfect equipment within a clinical room. Additionally, the robot features omnidirectional wheels, enabling it to navigate along a predefined path to efficiently and effectively 
complete the disinfection process.

## [INTRODUCTION TO ROBOTICS TUTORIAL](Introduction%20to%20Robotics%20Tutorial/)
In this project, three tasks were performed in the Epson Lab.
The three tasks use an I/O Box to control the robot and the Task 3 uses tools designed and fabricated in 3D printer.

For more details about coding, electrical connection and manufactured pieces used in the task, access to the link in the title "Introcution to Robotics Tutorial"
### Task 1: Pick and Place
In this Task, the robot must efficiently pick 3 tokens and 3 blocks using its vacuum nozzle from a feeder located within the workspace of the arm robot
After picking the token or block the robot must moved to an alignment plate to ensure a better performance, after the robot collects the token/block from 
alignment must tranfered to a tray in its corresponding position
### Task 2: Stacking
In this Task, the robot must collect 10 tokens and 10 blocks from the feeder using its vacuum nozzle and must stack them alternately over a platform located 
in the workspace of the robot
### Task 3: Integration
