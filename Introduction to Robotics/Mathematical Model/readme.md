# Mathematical Model for Robotic Arm Kinematics and Simulation

This section is designed to simulate and analyze the motion of a **3-DOF robotic manipulator**

---

## Key Functions of the Codes

1. **Forward Kinematics**:
   - Computes the position and orientation of the robot's end-effector (X, Y, Z) based on given joint angles.
   - Allows users to verify the robot's configuration for specific inputs.

2. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Determines the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position.
   - Useful for planning tasks where the target position is known but the joint angles are not.

3. **Trajectory Planning**:
   - Generates a smooth path between an initial and target joint configuration using the `jtraj` function.
   - Simulates the motion of the robot and visualizes the end-effector's path in 3D space.

4. **Jacobian Matrix Calculation**:
   - Computes the Jacobian matrix, which relates joint velocities to end-effector velocities.
   - Helps analyze how the robot moves and understand its dexterity and singularities.

5. **Workspace Generation**:
   - Calculates and visualizes the reachable workspace of the robotic arm by iterating through all possible joint configurations.
   - Displays the robot's motion capabilities in 2D and 3D projections.
