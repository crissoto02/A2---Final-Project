# Robot Details 🛠️💻
The project features a robotic arm designed for clinical disinfection, equipped with UVC lights distributed along its structure to enhance reach and ensure effective light angles for thorough surface disinfection. The articulated design provides flexibility and coverage, enabling it to disinfect complex surfaces such as beds, furniture, and overbed tables. Unlike rigid, stationary UVC systems, the robotic arm's overactuated design optimizes movement and adaptability for various clinical environments. The system incorporates mathematical modeling and simulation using MATLAB and Simulink to validate the design and optimize its performance.
