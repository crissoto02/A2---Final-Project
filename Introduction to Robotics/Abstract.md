This project addresses the inefficiencies in manual disinfection and the associated workload on healthcare workers by designing a robotic arm equipped with UVC lights for clinical environments. 
The proposed solution aims to prevent cross-infection between patients while improving overall hygiene. This system benefits both patients, by reducing infection risks, and workers, by automating a 
time-intensive task.

The primary goal is to ensure effective disinfection of clinical rooms, including surfaces such as beds, furniture, and overbed tables. The robotic arm incorporates UVC lights distributed along its 
structure, allowing for better reach and improved light angles to ensure thorough disinfection of all surfaces. Unlike conventional UVC systems, which are typically rigid and stationary, this design 
integrates an articulated robotic arm to maximize flexibility and coverage. 

The project leverages MATLAB and Simulink for mathematical modeling and simulation to validate the armâ€™s functionality and optimize its performance. Expected outcomes include improved hygiene 
standards and more efficient disinfection processes in healthcare settings. By introducing an overactuated robotic arm for UVC disinfection, this project innovatively combines robotics and healthcare 
to create a scalable and effective solution for infection control.
